# House-rent
Solving a regression problem
# Housing Rental Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict housing rental prices using machine learning techniques. The primary focus involves solving the regression task through the implementation of a Random Forest model. Additionally, a simple neural network has been constructed for comparison purposes. To enhance the performance of the models, categorical feature transformation was carried out using the LabelEncoder, and normalization techniques were applied.

## Methods Used

- Regression: Random Forest
- Neural Network: Simple architecture

## Feature Transformation

Categorical features were transformed using the LabelEncoder method to convert them into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

## Normalization

Normalization was performed on the dataset to ensure that the features were on a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the learning process.

## Implementation Details

The project utilizes two main models: a Random Forest regression model and a basic neural network. The Random Forest model excels in handling complex relationships and capturing non-linear patterns in the data. Meanwhile, the neural network provides an alternative approach, leveraging a simple architecture for comparison purposes.

## Conclusion

By combining the power of Random Forest and neural networks, this project strives to achieve accurate predictions of housing rental prices. The preprocessing steps, including feature transformation and normalization, contribute to the overall success of the models in handling diverse datasets.
